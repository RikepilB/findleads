# findleads — Handoff (father)

**Read this first.** Whole-project handoff. Freshest state on top, then an append-only
index of every session folder. Nothing here is ever deleted — full prose lives in each
session's own `HANDOFF.md`; this file is the map.

## How this works (tree of context)

```
docs/handoff/
  HANDOFF.md                  ← this file (father): rolling current state + session index
  .current-session            ← pointer: active session folder name (used by the hooks)
  _meta/TEMPLATE.md           ← per-session template
  <YYYY-MM-DD>-<name>/        ← one immutable folder per session
    HANDOFF.md                ← session digest: goal · done · files · failed · next
    transcript.md             ← optional full /export archive
```

**Rules:** append, never overwrite. Only the father's `## Current state` is replaced each
session. Solved tasks → one concrete one-liner (file / PR / command).

## Current state — 2026-07-01

Not "no product decided" — a brainstorming session already locked in the MVP design (Google
Maps/Places API leads scraper for Toronto + Lima, Next.js full-stack, Neon Postgres, DB-backed
job polling, no auth/billing in MVP). See the session folder below for the full decision list.
**No code written yet** and no permanent spec file exists — next step is writing
`docs/specs/2026-07-01-findleads-mvp-design.md` and getting it reviewed before implementation.

## Session index (append-only, newest first)

- 2026-07-01-mvp-design-brainstorm — architecture/data-model brainstorming, several MVP
  decisions locked in, ended mid-design awaiting user approval on section 1. Migrated from a
  root-level `PROYECTOS/handoff.md` that predated this repo's own handoff tree.
